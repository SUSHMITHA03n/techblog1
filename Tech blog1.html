        <h2>Trends in Artificial Intelligence 2020</h2>
		<p class="sp">
			1) Deep learning:
               Deep learning is an Artificial Intelligence form, which develops algorithms called artificial neural networks working by modeling the human brain function and structure.
               Machine learning has been in demand for a long time, however, jobs including deep learning have risen 35 fold between 2015 and 2017.
               Numerous areas of Artificial intelligence technology like computer vision, autonomous vehicles, automatic text generation and so on are the fields where deep learning use is at its peak.
